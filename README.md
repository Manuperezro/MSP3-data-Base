## Deployment:

### Inception:

 + this project was created using Code Institute template from GitHub:

 + After the creation of the project, I rename it as : The-Climbing-Club-MS2.

 + In order to push this project from GitPod to Github I used a set of git commands on the terminal: 
  
- git status  - Check the status of the repository and see if there were any changes in files 

- git add .  - Add the files that were modified/created, so we can commit it 

- git commit -m "message for commit"  - Commits all the changes

- git push  - Pushes all committed versions to GitHub.

#### Deployment to GitHub Pages:

+ The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

- Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository

- At the top of repository click on "Settings"

- Once you are in settings scroll down to "GitHub Pages"

- Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

- After the page automatically refresh scroll down again on "GitHub Pages" and I will  see live link to the published site.


### Cloning repository:

+ Local Clone

- Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository

- At the top of repository click on Code

- From the dropdown menu under HTTPS copy the link

- Now on the IDE create a directory where you want to make the clone

- Type git clone and paste the link that you copy from step 3.


### Forking repository:

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on - - the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
