    ## Design:

   ### Theme and Colour Scheme

The theme is inspired by a chopping borad and the elemts a chef used to prepare a pleasent meal and is intended to appeal a minimalism and clean chopping board. A clean and modern colour scheme with contrasting and complementary colours was chosen to reflect a sense of simple energy. Coolors was used to generate two colour palettes which were incorporated as utility classes in the CSS file, to be easily called upon directly from the HTML files.


### Design Brief:

+ Colour:

### Bugs and Errors during development:

- Recipes History Not loading.

The issue :

When I first tryed to create a history page with all the existing recipes in the Recipes page, the template was render ok, but the list was empty, it wasen't passing the data from the History model.

The solution : 

I tried to simplify the code, and to used what was already working and retieving data, So made the following changes (Check images below for more details), and try collect the data from the Recipes model, as the results was the same. The user was able to see a list with all the created recipes.

## Deployment:



### Inception:


 + this project was created using Code Institute template from GitHub:

 + After the creation of the project, I rename it as : The-Climbing-Club-MS2.

 + In order to push this project from GitPod to Github I used a set of git commands on the terminal: 
  
- git status  - Check the status of the repository and see if there were any changes in files 

- git add .  - Add the files that were modified/created, so we can commit it 

- git commit -m "message for commit"  - Commits all the changes

- git push  - Pushes all committed versions to GitHub.



#### Deployment to GitHub Pages:

+ The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

- Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository

- At the top of repository click on "Settings"

- Once you are in settings scroll down to "GitHub Pages"

- Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".

- After the page automatically refresh scroll down again on "GitHub Pages" and I will  see live link to the published site.


#### Deployment to Heroku Pages:

+ The project was deployed on Heroku from the master branch. To do this, the following steps were taken:

- from your terminal (CLI), create a requirements.txt and Procfile using these commands:#

  -- pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
  -- echo web: python app.py > Procfile

- Sign up and login to Heroku, create a new app

- Go to the Deploy tab and then Deployment Method and select Github

- Under Connect to Github enter your details and connect your repository

- Next, go to settings and select Config Vars and then Reveal Config Vars

- You need to enter the following variables to match what you have stored in your env.py file

  -- IP : 0.0.0.0
  -- PORT : 5000
  -- DATABASE_URI : DATABASE_URI",
  -- SECRET_KEY : <app secret key>

- Under the Deploy tab go to Automatic Deploys and enable

- Under Manual Deploy, choose Master and click Deploy Branch

- Heroku will begin building the app. When it is ready, you can click Open app to launch it.


### Cloning repository:

+ Local Clone

- Log in to GitHub and locate GitHub Repository

- At the top of repository click on Code

- From the dropdown menu under HTTPS copy the link

- Now on the IDE create a directory where you want to make the clone

- Type git clone and paste the link that you copy from step 3.


### Forking repository:

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on - - the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
